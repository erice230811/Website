   <h2> What is HTML?</h2>
   <p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. <br>HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
<br>The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS.
   </p>
<h2> The History of HTML</h2>
<p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989.<br> It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
    <br>Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document <br>or to another document altogether.<br> The latest version is known as HTML5.
    <br>A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented.<br> To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

    <h2> What Are HTML Tags?</h2>
    <p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.<br> 
Most tags must be opened and closed  in order to function.</p>
<h2>What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
<p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information.<br> Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
